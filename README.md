Time Series Cross-Valiation
===

This is a package to automate the cross-validation of time-series models, particularly those created by the forecast and caret packages.

Install as follows:
devtools::install.github('zachmayer/cv.ts')

This package has been off my radar screen for a long time, and I need to write lots of documentation and tests.  Please add issues to the issue tracker, and I welcome any pull requests.
